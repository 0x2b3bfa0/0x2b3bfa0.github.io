Usually, about pages are meant to let the readers know more about the writers' personal tribulations. After reading half a dozen of tutorials about how to write an excellent about page, I realized that they were written to attract followers and visitors, and that is far away from my desire, as this blog is only intended to post some ideas and projects that won't be useful nor interesting for the vast majority of the target audience for these "miracle about page recommendations", so I'm sorry if this is not what you expected. You can infer my personality by reading my posts and repositories.
