Usually, about pages are meant to let the readers know more about the writers' personal tribulations. After reading half a dozen of tutorials about how to write an excellent about page, I realized that these tutorials were written to attracting followers and visitors, and that is far from my desire, as this blog is only intended to post some ideas and projects that won't be useful nor interesting for the vast majority of those "miracle about page recommendations" target audience, so I'm sorry if this is not what you expected. You can infer how I am by reading my posts and repositories.
