Well, normally the bloggers should write a good about page to let the readers know more about it without boring them. After reading half a dozen of tutorials about how to write an excellent about page, I realized that these tutorials were written with the idea of attracting followers and visitors, and I don't want that. This blog is intended only to post some ideas and projects that won't be useful nor interesting for the vast majority of the target audience of those "miracle about page" recommendations. I'm sorry if this is not what you expected.

I'm the writer of this about page. You can infer how I am by reading my posts.
