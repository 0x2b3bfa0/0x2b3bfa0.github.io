This is the long story (as my mom would say, the story of the elephant, book thousand, chapter eleven):

I'm a human being born at the begin of the 21th century (or a "robot", as I fail solving some captchas) constrained by the time limit of the 24 hours of the day. I'm a majorly self-taught being avid of learning all what I consider useful. I started using Linux ([MoLinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinux)) when I was 8, and then I started to learn computing, as that seemed me useful and funny.

Around that year, I met [Francisco Manuel Garc√≠a Claramonte](https://github.com/fgclaramonte), who worked on the MoLinux project on the city where I was living then, and he kindly answered the questions I had about the basic and semi-advanced usage of MoLinux. His aid was very helpful for me, as he saved me hours of Internet search and even he explained me things that were not documented yet in the web (like how to get that Conexant 56K modem to work on Linux).

A couple of years later, the MoLinux project was discontinued with the change in the government. Don't ask me why. To understand these things you must live 10 years in Spain. First we create a "new" Linux distribution instead of helping the people to use an existing one and then we realize that this was overkilling. Also, when the government changes all the things done by the last one are systematically reverted. Like on the ancient Egypt. They even built a few pyramids... upside down. However, that project helped a lot of people and this is good. I'm very happy with the result.

In that moment I had enough time to learn a bit of Linux administration, Bash and [Gambas](http://gambas.sourceforge.net). All these things were useful for me. At the end of that year I created a simple application to keep track of the participants of a congress using QR codes and a Sqlite3 database. All programmed in Gambas, except the QR reading that was done with [ZBar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZBar) and the TTS using [festival](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_(TTS)) along with [hispavoces](https://github.com/guadalinex-archive/hispavoces).

That Christmas, my father gave me some PIC16F84A and an Arduino Mega 2560. Then I started to learn C++, Microchip assembly and electronics (both superficially). I started to interest in the hardware and managed to spin some spare stepper motors using a ULN2003. Then I could add a few new interests to the list, along with the software, playing with my friends to real life games and reading insane amounts of books at blazingly fast speeds. This helped me to join the hardware and the software worlds.

Then I started to learn a bit of PHP (now partially forgotten), ECMAScript, CSS and HTML. This was not a big step forward, but I knew later that all there things were very useful. As I can't stay inactive, I started to interest by hacking (nothing to do with that typical balaclava-wearing guy holding a laptop stock picture) and programming. I learned a bit of Python, C, x86 assembly, WiFi security and networking. All this on-demand while doing some reverse engineering and security testing practices.

Later I returned to the hardware when I had to learn how to use the laser cutter and CNC mill that my parents bought. I started to learn G-code and design with FreeCAD, Inkscape and Blender. This helped me to widen my interests a bit more.

Once I had a bit of background in computing and that sort of sciences, I started to do some (successful) projects in the security testing, programming, data recovery and electronics fields
